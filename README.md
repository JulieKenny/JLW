Tools for the data wrangler

This is the start of a tool which will provide those maintaining and building data warehouses to manage the day-to-day activities 
which go on when things go wrong, or even go right but you really need to be sure.

It's the first application I've written in Java so some of this code will be awful and it's likely to get re-written a few
times.
The back-end is MongoDB, one reason for this is that the source of a data warehouse is likely to be a mix of data types even 
though the warehouse itself is probably just one. There are other reasons too I may disclose later.
